In the following, I use GotoBLAS BLAS library thus matrices are in Fortran format (column Major).
Please, build the FastMMW library accordingly with GotoBLAS column major format.

1) How to build and install the Python FastMMWP package

   In the usual approach 
   
   Install numpy.  Please, take a look at the setup.py for further
   information about the process. This is specific for GotoBLAS and A8
   AMD machine.  Please redirect the appropriate include
   directories:


   python = "/usr/include/python2.5/"
   numpy = "/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/"
   
   I personally install this package using python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7

   python setup.py build; sudo python setup.py install


2) How to run: 

   First you will need to make visible the Goto's library:

   For example: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/paolo/fusion/paolo/Desktop/MM/GotoBLAS2/

   where ever your GotoLibrary is  

   python temp.py -i 5 -s 500 -p -r 1

   An example such as temp.py provide how to call the routines and how to use them.

3) how to recreate the files of the package:

   cd ../Script
   python generateBasicInterface.py -c FastMMWRcode.h -p ../Python/FastMMWPCode.h -P ../Python/FastMMWPHeader.h

   where FastMMWRcode.h is a C interface to use basic types to
   transform into Matrix types used in FastMM@W library
   
   where FastMMWPCode.h is the actual Python Interface taking python
   objects and transforming into basic types. 

   where FastMMWPHeader.h is the package contract APIs
